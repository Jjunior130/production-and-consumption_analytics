Each body transforms the consumption of external resources, some type of energy,
into the production of internal resources, the type of energy the body needs
to survive and prolong its life.

The produced internal resources depletes as the body consumes it; Consumption
happens at some rate.

The body consumes its internal resources to function.

So the rate at which the body produces its internal resources must be maintained
above the rate at which the body consumes it.
